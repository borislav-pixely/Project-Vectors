# Project Vectors

### Description: 
A console application written in C++ as part of a university course to perform operations with geometrical objects such as points, lines, triangles, vectors.

### Preview:
#### This is the menu of the application that is displayed when the user starts the application.

The user can choose between several options:
1. Point
2. Vector
3. Line
4. Segment
5. Triangle
6. Tetrahedron
7. Clear console history
8. Read from a file with operations
0. Exit from the application

#### Here, we're choosing option 2 to perform operations on vectors.

The available operations to perform on vectors here are:
1. Caclulating the length of a vector
2. Calculating the direction of a vector
3. Projecting a vector on another vector
4. Checking for a zero (null) vector
5. Checking if two vectors are parallel to each other
6. Checking if two vectors are perpendicular to each other
7. Adding two vectors together
8. Subtracting two vectors
9. Multiplying a vector with a real number
10. Multiplication of two vectors with scalar 
11. Multiplication of two vectors
12. Combined multiplication of three vectors
0. Exit the menu

#### Let's try to simply add two vectors together. We'll input option 7 and enter the data for two vectors: x and y.

Here we can see the result of adding two vectors together.

#### Now, let's try to check if they are perpendicular by choosing option 6 and selecting to use the previous two vectors x and y.

Here we can see that the output says vectors x and y are not perpendicular to each other.

#### Finally, if we check in the folder where the console application lives, we'll see that it automatically saved an output file with all the operations we just performed.
